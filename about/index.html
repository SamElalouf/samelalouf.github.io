	<h1 style="font-family:Garamond; style="font-size: 28px;">About Me</h1>
	<p>I work as an educator, editor, and writer. I have spent the past four years working as a professor and tutor at colleges and universities in the Atlanta area. I have taught courses in philosophy, ethics, logic, and critical thinking. I also have worked as an academic writing tutor for college students and non-native speakers of English. Alongside my career in academia, I work as a freelance writer and journalist covering politics and culture and occasionally writing critical essays. I have also worked as an editor for academics working in philosophy and psychology. </p>
