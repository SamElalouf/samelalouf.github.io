	<p> I have taught college courses in critical thinking, logic, philosophy, and business ethics for the past three years. I have also worked as a tutor for college and high school students and learners of English.<br>
								 
<br>I previously taught at Georgia State University, where I completed my Master's Degree, and am now an adjunct professor at Georgia Perimeter College.<br>

<br>I am currently teaching two sections of a course on Critical Thinking for the Summer 2018 term at Georgia Perimeter College.<br>

<br>I offer private tutoring sessions starting at $50 per hour. I am available for online tutoring or for in-person tutoring in the Metro-Atlanta area. </p>
